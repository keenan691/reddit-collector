* Overview

The task is to create an app that will get popular Reddits using provided endpoint and create an output file with a specified structure.

* Acceptance criteria

** Create a Clojure project using Leiningen or Clojure deps.
** Collect data reliably (network or api issues) from https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/popular/.json?limit=100
** Partially validate the data against spec (malli or clojure.spec). It is sufficient to validate the fields that are exported to the output json files.
** Write tests
** Output data to json file

* Output file format

Example:
#+begin_src json
  {
    "popular_reddits": [
      {
        "name": "r/Home",
        "description": "Everything home related: interior design, home improvement, architecture...",
        "created_at": "2009-01-25T03:25:57Z"
      },
      {
        "name": "AskReddit",
        "description": "###### [ [ SERIOUS ] ](http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/submit?selftext=true&amp;title=%5BSerious%5D)...",
        "url": "https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/",
        "created_at": "2008-01-25T04:52:15Z"
